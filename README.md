# Project Title
Hotel Booking Prediction System
## Description
The Hotel Booking Prediction System leverages machine learning to predict booking outcomes and provide actionable insights for hotel management. By analyzing historical booking data, the system forecasts whether a booking will result in a confirmed stay or cancellation. This tool is designed to help hotels optimize operations, manage inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction by predicting demand and improving planning accuracy.

Key Features:

1. Predicts the likelihood of a booking being confirmed or cancelled.
2. Analyzes attributes like historical booking data, including customer demographics, seasonal trends, and booking patterns.
3. Provides insights to improve hotel resource allocation and revenue management.
4. Supports data-driven decision-making to maximize occupancy rates.
